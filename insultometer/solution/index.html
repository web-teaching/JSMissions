    <h1>Insult-O-Meter</h1>

    <!--
    First let's make some HTML!
    1. Make a div with the class "insult-box"
    2. Make a paragraph inside the insult box with the id "insult-text"
    3. Make a button that says "Say It!"

    Now let's style it with CSS!
    1. Make the font use a cursive font
    2. Make the insult text use a different font
    3. Make the insult box colorful. Give it a border with a border radius

    Now let's write some JavaScript!
    1. Write a function and call it when the insult button is clicked.
    2. Make the function put some text in the insult text paragraph
    3. Make an array of insults or complements
    4. Make the function grab a random element from the array and put it in the insult text paragraph
